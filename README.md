🚴‍♂️ Bike Demand Prediction
This project aims to predict bike rental demand using historical data and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes daily records of bike rental counts along with weather and seasonal information. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast bike demand, which could be useful for bike-sharing systems, urban planning, and resource allocation.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following key features:
Date: Daily timestamp.
Season: Categorical variable (spring, summer, fall, winter).
Weather: Weather situation (clear, cloudy, light rain, etc.).
Temperature: Normalized temperature in Celsius.
Humidity: Normalized humidity level.
Windspeed: Wind speed.
Casual / Registered / Total users: Number of bike rentals.
The data preprocessing steps include:
Converting date columns to datetime format.
One-hot encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing numerical features.
Dropping irrelevant columns if necessary.

🧠 Model Training (Planned)
In the next phase of the project, we will train and evaluate several machine learning models, including but not limited to:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost
Decision Tree Regressor
Support Vector Regression (SVR)

The performance of each model will be compared using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to improve model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
